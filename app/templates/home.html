            Why choose <span class="special">'Time to Move'</span> ?
        </h2>
        <p class="col-1">
            Due to the quarantine effect, many people have gotten quite lazy. Moreover, for many persons it may not be easy for everyone to adjust to the online environment. I’m sure even some of us  have had days where Bruno Mars’, “Lazy Song” could have been our theme song, as we went the whole day and did nothing but sleep, eat and watch tv. 
        </p>
        <p class="col-2">
            Now, we aren’t saying those kinds of days are bad, but sometimes we have those days when we want to be productive and that’s where this app comes in.
            <br>
            Our App, “Time To Move”, aims to act as a personal assistant which helps us to get or maintain a healthy lifestyle, have those satisfyingly productive days and still allow time to eat and watch our favourite series or anime.
